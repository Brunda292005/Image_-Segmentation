# 🧩 Image Segmentation with Deep Learning

This project performs semantic image segmentation using deep learning. Image segmentation is the process of labeling each pixel in an image with a class, allowing us to distinguish different objects or regions within an image.

## 🧠 What is Image Segmentation?

Unlike classification or detection, segmentation provides **pixel-level understanding** of the image. It’s useful in applications like:

- Medical imaging (tumor detection)
- Self-driving cars (road/lane segmentation)
- Satellite image analysis
- Industrial defect detection
